	<h2 class="bigspace"> <u> Context: </u></h2>
		<p class="alex2"> In addition to the immense role music has played in my individual life, it’s also been a huge part of my friendships and relationships over the years. Whether it’s the shared experiences of concerts, what’s played in the car while driving around picking people up, or even how songs once shared with someone can shift with their memory, music is how we soundtrack our lives. Especially since meeting more people that are into creating music, its performance and sharing has also been a source of memories as well. </em> </p>

		<p class="alex2"> In a world where one’s attention is a commodity constantly fought for, the element of mindfulness in using music to ascribe a sound to the emotion that the present moment calls for is a beautiful practice that’s been impactful to me long before I could articulate why.  </em></strong>  </p>
