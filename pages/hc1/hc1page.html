		<h2 class="bigspace"> Impact</h2>
		<p class="alex2"> Like the work of much other good design, the <strong>relationship</strong> between music and its coupled artwork express a cohesion often felt, even if not overtly recognized, that can affect the art’s experience as a whole. Especially with physical music media like records, CDs, and tapes, cover art and album packaging play a huge role in what even draws your attention. A precursor to the music itself, cover art helps us “eat with our eyes” and sooner find what’s interesting if done well and cohesively. I’ve long been fascinated by, and appreciative of, the interplay between music and its respective visuals, and how the two can come together to create something greater than the sum of its parts. </p>

		<h2 class="bigspace"> Examples</h2>
		<p> Ranging from traditional photography to mixed media to digital collages, a large part of visual art's strength is its versatility to relate, and be coupled to, other media. I might argue that there aren’t two types of art more mutually beneficial than the relationship between music and visuals. From the MTV era of the 80s and 90s, to the decades-long tradition of album covers and promotional material, music and some type of visual art are nearly inseparable. Below, I have a couple examples of how cover art and its components can not only create a visual facade for the music, but tell a story under the surface.</p>

		<h2 id="hex2" class="bigspace"> <u> Jai Paul Cover (04-13 Leak, Bait Ones)</u></h2>
		<img class="JaiPaul" src="Jai Paul 04-13 Cover.png" width="500px" alt="Jai Paul Cover">

		<p> <ul>As seen above, Jai Paul's cover for Leak 04-13 features a whole host of elements and colors that help clue you in on where the record's coming from before ever pressing play; encompassing (but not limited to):
			<li> Bears</li>
			<li> Hot air balloons</li>
			<li> Various portraits</li>
			<li> Fennec Fox</li>
			<li> An astronaut</li>
		</ul> </p>

		<p> Though the Jai Paul cover works well with obvious and overt collage elements, I (and plenty of other designers) find collage to be a helpful part of the process and pulling together a vision/idea, regardless of if the final idea stays in such raw form. Like a visually appealing scrapbook, the content of album art often has deeper meanings and stories to its components that can be a time capsule to those on one side of the curtain, and lore worth digging into for listeners on the other.</p>

		<h2 id="hex2" class="bigspace"><u>AMAQU Cover</u></h2>
		<blockquote>Cover designed by me, (Spotify <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4Jk4zWEbKHc2LR06NT1EMm">link</a> to the album) </blockquote>
		<img class="AMAQU" src="AMAQU-Cover-Bounce.jpg" width="500px" alt="AMAQU Cover">

		<p> In a personal example, last year I got to design the album cover and accompanying artwork for a project two of my friends put out. Though monochromatic and relatively even-keeled, I constructed the cover of various images I had taken of Josh and Colin, components from said images, and even resampled artwork my friend Josh did a couple years back. A time capsule as much as a visual aid to the music, the pictures used speak to a certain period, creatively, in life, and in our friendship. Around late October last year, we went into Brooklyn with little plans other than taking some photos, and now have a piece of art to remember and celebrate. However, a big part of art’s beauty is that it’s up for interpretation, and tends to settle on a meaning most impactful to its viewer. Where I see one story in these images, someone else may see things entirely differently. Rooted in meaning but thriving in ambiguity, music and visual art work to solidify a vision, while still evoking new meanings in the mind of the audience.</p>
