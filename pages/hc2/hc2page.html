	<h2 class="bigspace"> <u> Context: </u></h2>
		<p class="alex2"> For as long as cameras have been accessible to the everyman, photography has been an important part of documenting and commemorating life events, places, people, and everything in between. Photos (especially with context) have a unique power to capture a moment, and the emotions that come with it. In the context of music, the creative process often exists in perpetuity, with a photo from a certain album cycle/tour likely tying in pretty directly to the music and creative output of that time. When looking at an old family photo, one may feel emotions associated with that time and memory. <em> When looking at a studio/behind the scenes photo of music one holds dear, you may feel a deeper connection and humanity to the art. </em> </p>

<h2 class="bigspace"> <u> Application: </u></h2>
		<p class="alex2"> As a lot of my favorite studio photos and documentation are impromptu rather than planned shots, I find them not only to be fun pieces of history and lore, but inspirations on process. I’ve found time and time again that “getting out of your own way” is a major key to uninhibited expression and creative practice, and seeing musicians and artists I admire in that state always serves as a welcome reminder. I’m far from alone in seeing the value in such media, as behind the scenes footage and content from big artists routinely puts up hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of views online. Whether its packaged in physical media, posted directly online, or rare footage on a fan channel with a thousand views, there’s a good market for getting a look behind the curtain on great art and the people that make it. By serving to demystify great art by showing humble beginnings in a bedroom recording studio, <strong> good studio footage can allow us to see ourselves in artists, and artists as they are: <em>people with a drive to create.</em></strong>  </p>
